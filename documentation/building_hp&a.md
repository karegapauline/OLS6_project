# Web design and development
## Resources used
- GitHub pages
- HTML & CSS

## Steps
1. Open GitHub repo : OLS6_project is the name of our repo
2. Open a second branch site in your repo, so you'll have main and site
3. Create index.html and style.css files in your site branch and add some information
4. In GitHub, go to settings and scroll upto the pages tab. You'll see branch (where you want your website to be deployed from), switch that from main to site and save. NOTE: do not change root.
5. Your website is saved as https://ghusername.io/folderyoubuildfrom : The next step can be to give this a custom domain which you can do from the same pages tab.
